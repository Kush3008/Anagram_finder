# Anagram Finder

The Anagram Finder is a Python application that helps you discover anagram groups and non-anagram words from a list of space-separated words. This project demonstrates the use of custom styling with the customtkinter library to create an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing graphical user interface (GUI) for interacting with the Anagram Finder.

## Key Features

1. **Anagram Group Detection**: The Anagram Finder efficiently identifies anagram groups within the provided list of words. Anagram groups are sets of words that contain the same characters and can be rearranged to form each other.

2. **Non-Anagram Word Detection**: Apart from finding anagram groups, the application also identifies non-anagram words, which are words that do not have any anagrams within the given list.

3. **Custom Styling**: The customtkinter library is employed to enhance the visual appeal of the GUI, providing a cohesive and modern look to the application.

4. **Clear Functionality**: The "Clear" button allows you to reset the input and result sections, providing a seamless experience for multiple searches.

5. **User-Friendly Interaction**: The user-friendly interface ensures easy input of words and convenient display of anagram groups and non-anagram words.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- customtkinter library (a custom-styled version of the standard tkinter library)

## Special Features

- Intuitive GUI with custom styling for an enhanced visual experience.
- Clear button to reset input and result sections quickly.

## Additional Notes

The Anagram Finder project is designed to showcase how Python and the customtkinter library can be used to create an elegant and functional graphical user interface for solving a specific problem. The application's primary focus is on efficiently identifying anagram groups and non-anagram words while maintaining an attractive and user-friendly design.
